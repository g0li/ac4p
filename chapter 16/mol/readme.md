================================

This is a sample cordova plugin from my [Apache Cordova 4 Programming](www.cordova4programming.com) book. It's used as an example of how to build a JavaScript-only plugin that calculates the "Answer to The Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything" (From Douglas Adams' The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy).
